 This is an example of how the persistence for marked-for-deletion works in PhotoManager:
 
 1. When a user marks a photo for deletion by swiping left or using the delete button:
    - The photo's localIdentifier is added to the markedForDeletion Set 
    - The markForDeletion method calls saveMarkedForDeletion
    - This saves the identifiers to a JSON file in the app's Documents directory
 
 2. When the app launches: 
    - The PhotoManager initializer calls loadMarkedForDeletion
    - This loads identifiers from the JSON file and populates the markedForDeletion Set
 
 3. When fetching photos:
    - The fetchPhotoGroupsByYearAndMonth method filters out assets whose identifiers
      are in the markedForDeletion Set (line ~147-150)
    - This ensures that photos marked for deletion stay hidden even after app restart
 
 4. When photos are actually deleted from the device:
    - hardDeleteAssets method is called
    - After deletion, identifiers are removed from markedForDeletion
    - saveMarkedForDeletion is called again to update the persisted storage
 
 Example debugging test:
 
 ```swift
 // Debugging test for persistence (not unit test)
 func testMarkedForDeletionPersistence() {
     // 1. Mark some photos for deletion
     let photoManager = PhotoManager()
     
     // 2. Wait for the app to load photos
     // (In production, we'd add a few photos to markedForDeletion)
     
     // 3. Check if photos are correctly filtered in fetchPhotoGroupsByYearAndMonth 
     //    by reviewing the log output when app loads
     
     // 4. Kill and restart the app
     
     // 5. Verify the photos remain hidden after app restart
 }
 ```
 
 The persistence mechanism works automatically as long as the PhotoManager is used
 for all operations related to marking photos for deletion.
